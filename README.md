ML Decision Tree Assignment 1

Both the source file are proper running code and both have post pruning implemented as well.

The only difference is that, "Source_single_run_for_two_datasets.cpp" file run only once getting the values of L and K at runtime and displays the tree with the accuracy before and after pruning.

Whereas "Source_continuous_5_runs_to_display_best_tree.cpp" , this file is modified to run for 5 times (option to break the loop is given at the end of each loop) to get the accuracy and finally displays the tree with the highest accuracy both the datasets.

Please the place the input datasets in two folders named "DS1", "DS2" in the same path as that of the source file. The output file will be generated in the same path as that of the source file.

Commands to complie:

g++ Source_continuous_5_runs_to_display_best_tree.cpp

or

g++ Source_single_run_for_two_datasets.cpp

Command to run 

./a.out
